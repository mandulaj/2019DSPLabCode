% The abstract
\begin{abstract}
The following report is composed of two main sections. Real-time audio processing with software, and a proposed high-level hardware design for real-time stereo audio processing. The software section of this report includes sample code to exercise the real-time performance of the Analog Devices ADSP-BF706 device. Applications explored include fractional channel gain manipulation, volume control, 16-bit bandpass and 32-bit stopband finite impulse response filtration, with corresponding coefficients, and sinusoidal generation. The aim of the hardware design is to create a stand-alone system capable of supporting the bandwidth requirements of studio-quality music; outlining key components, high-level connectivity and data flow.
